# Fun Readme
In the fun folder you'll find `counting`, `qotd`, `x-word-story` and `funinfo`. The latter is an optional command that accesses data that's stored when using one of the other CCs.

- Many responses that you can change to your liking.

### Setup:
- Set the custom command restrictions to only run in your counting channel

- A report of the previous QOTD gets send to a channel of choice

- Set the trigger type to **Regex** and the trigger to: `\A`

### Usage:
- "@QOTD What is your favourite food?" or "What is @QOTD's fav movie?". As long as you mention your QOTD role, it will work.
- The bot will then remove that message and resend it. (So you don't get pinged when people reply to your message ðŸ˜‰)
- On the next QOTD, the bot will send a report to your report channel with some info on the previous QOTD.

>1 Certain roles can be ignored, e.g. Staff (so they can moderate) and Nitro Boosters.

### Features:
- Accesses the data from all commands in this folder and shows it in a nice embed.
- Changable embed colour, defaults to a nice purple

`\A-funinfo(?:\s+(?:\d{17,19}|<@!?\d{17,19}>))?\z`
