# YAGPDB-CC Readme
## Description
My YAGPDB custom commands. Mostly ones I use myself.

## Visual Studio Code Extension
I've made an extension. You can check it out [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SpecialEliteSNP.yagpdb-cc). It just does a bit more than the other one.

## [Fun](https://github.com/SpecialEliteSNP/yagpdb-cc/tree/main/fun#fun-readme)
The fun folder features the fun CCs. It includes `counting.yag`, `qotd.yag`, `x-word-story.yag` and `funinfo.yag`. They all pretty much do as their name suggests. Funinfo is a special cc that combines the data collected from the other CCs and shows them in a nice embed.

## [Useful](https://github.com/SpecialEliteSNP/yagpdb-cc/tree/main/useful#useful-readme)
The useful folder features CCs that are not meant to be used on their own with the exception of `sticky-message.yag`. They are rather to be used in your own CCs, each with their own purpose.
